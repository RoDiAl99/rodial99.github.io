I am led to hope that the import of the Charge delivered to you in the First Degree neither has been, nor ever will be, effaced from your memory. I shall, therefore, content myself with observing that as you have had an opportunity of making yourself acquainted in the First Degree with the principles of Moral Truth and Virtue, you are now in this Degree <span class="page">148</span>required to extend your researches to the more hidden paths of Nature and Science.</div>

<h2 id="10">Working Tools</h2>
<div tabindex="0" class="RWM"><span class="RWMintro">R.W.M.</span>W.S.W., you will explain the Working Tools of this Degree.</div>
<div class="text">The S.D. places the N. in front of the S.W.'s pedestal.</div>
<div tabindex="0" class="SW"><span class="SWintro">S.W.</span>Bro. A.B., by command of the R.W.M. I present to you the working tools of a F.C.F. They are the S..., the L... and the P... R... The S... is used by Operative Masons to try, and to adjust, all rectangular corners of buildings and to assist in bringing rude matter into due form. The L... is to lay levels and prove horizontals. And the P... R... is to try, and to adjust all uprights while fixing them on their proper bases.<br>
But as we are not Operative, but Free and Accepted, or Speculative Masons, we apply these tools as symbols and invest them with a moral significance.<span class="page">149</span>
Thus the S... teaches us to regulate our actions by the Masonic line and rule and to correct and harmonise our conduct.
The L... demonstrates that we are all sprung from the same stock, are partakers of the same nature and sharers of the same hope and that, although distinctions among men are highly necessary to preserve due subordination and to reward merit and ability, yet no eminence of station should cause us to forget that we are Brn.<br>
The infallible P... R... teaches us to walk uprightly in our several stations; to hold the scales of justice with an equal poise, so that neither passion nor prejudice cause us to deviate from the strict path of virtue, and thus to observe a due medium, the golden mean in all things.<br>
Hence, the S... teaches us the morality, the L... equality, and the P... R..., justness and uprightness of life and actions; so that by s... conduct, l... steps and upright intentions, we may hope to <span class="page">150</span>ascend to a higher realisation of that Immortal Principle whence all goodness emanates.</div>

<h2 id="11">A Charge in the Second Degree</h2>
<div class="text">Usually omitted.</div>

<div tabindex="0" class="IPM"><span class="IPMintro">I.P.M.</span>Now that you have duly been passed to the Second Degree we congratulate you <span class="page">151</span>on your preferment. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the duties which as a Mason you are bound to discharge, or to enlarge on the necessity of a strict adherence to them, as your own experience must have established their value. In your new character it is expected that you will not only conform to the principles of the Order, but steadily persevere in the practice of every virtue. The study of the liberal arts, which tend so effectually to polish and adorn the mind, is earnestly recommended to your consideration, especially the science of geometry, which is established as the basis of our Art. You are to preserve our ancient usages and customs sacred and inviolable, and induce others by your example to hold them in veneration. The laws and regulations of the Order you are strenuously to support and maintain. You are not to palliate or aggravate the offences of your Brn.; but in the decision of every trespass against our rules, judge with candour, admonish <span class="page">152</span>with friendship and reprehend with mercy. As a C.n in our private assemblies you may offer your opinions on such subjects as are introduced in the lecture, under the superintendence of an experienced Master who will guard the Landmarks against encroachment. By this privilege you may improve your intellectual powers, qualify yourself to become a useful member of society, and, like a skilful Bro., strive to excel in what is good and great. You are duly to honour and obey all regular s...s and summonses, given and received. You are to encourage industry and reward merit, supply the wants and relieve the necessities of the Brn. to the utmost of your power and ability, and on no account to wrong them or see them wronged, but timely to apprise them of approaching danger, and to view their interests as inseparable from your own. Such is the nature of your engagements as a F.C.F., and these duties you are bound by the most sacred ties to observe.<span class="page">153</span></div>
<div class="text">Before the Mystic Charge is given the following verse may be sung...</div>
<p class="song">Brother, faithful and deserving,<br/>
Now the second rank you fill;<br/>
Never from your purpose swerving,<br/>
Press straight onward higher still.<br/>
Thus from rank to rank ascending<br/>
Mounts the Mason's path of love;<br/>
Bright its earthly course, and ending<br/>
In the glorious Lodge above.</p>

<h2 id="12">Mystic Charge</h2>
<div class="text">Given by the I.P.M. or other P.M.</div>
<div tabindex="0" class="IPM"><span class="IPMintro">I.P.M.</span>NAs on your Initiation you were taught to regard the ceremony through which you had passed in a clearer and fuller light than that in which many Freemasons regard it, so now again must you realise that among us, the F.C. Degree carries with it a special teaching, and imposes upon your life certain responsibilities. This Degree represents those stages in the true Mysteries during which the<span class="page">154</span>Initiate is called to improve and polish his own nature, to develop his intellectual, artistic and psychic faculties, as during the stage of the E.A.F. he should specially cultivate his moral capacities. Moreover, he has a duty to the world in general as to his Brn. in Freemasonry in particular.
For the development of your intellectual and artistic powers, you, as a F.C., should consecrate some part of the T...-f... I... G... to the study of philosophy, science or art, choosing your subject according to the bent of your mind, and the type of your temperament. For the unfolding of your psychic capacities you should daily retire for a brief space from the outer world, and securing yourself against interruption, you should meditate steadily on the Beautiful, the True or the Good, striving to see with your inner vision the ideal you picture by your imagination. Thus may you win some of the hidden secrets of Nature and may communicate them, as you see fitting, to your Lodge working in the Second Degree.<br>
In the world you should be an example of serious and harmonious living, endeavouring to lead a nobly simple life, dignified and beautiful, a silent protest against the enfeebling luxury and the ugly ostentation of ordinary modern society. In your home, in your dress, in your gestures, in your speech, you should seek the congruous, the graceful, the delicate, the beautiful, remembering that true beauty is not dependent on wealth nor on social position, but on measured harmony, on congruity, on balance, on dignity, on the subordination of details to the whole, of the form to the idea. Study Nature and learn from her the harmonies of life, of colour and of form. Avoid all that is meretricious, showy and vulgar. Seek in art the ideal, and help the form to express the truth it veils, remembering that the ugly and distorted are Nature's failures, which she ever seeks to transmute.<br>
See to it, 8S a F.C., that the world is the better for your smoothing and polishing of the crude stones, and that the Temple we are raising for humanity becomes the fairer for your inclusion among C...n.</div>
